# Publisher Subcriber Model
## What it is ?
Publisher subscriber model is simply mean one machine is publishing some data or msg and other machines who are subscriber of publisher machine will recieve those data.
Let us understand this by example, we have a lot of youtube channels in youtube and let suppose you subscribe to channel A.Now, whenever A upload some videos you will recieve
it's notification.That means only subscribers of channel A will recieve these notifications not other users.
So,yess this model can be used in event/notification management,ordering even if client machine is off(not connected to network).

## Understand it by architecture
![pub-sub](https://github.com/Amark19/system-design/assets/71604396/038cf2cd-6aa7-418f-b674-639f71c8d8ca)

Here you can see we have three major components 
- Publisher
- msg broker()
- Subscribers
So, publisher publishes data to server now server push this data to message broker.Message broker breaks down this msges by topic(it's category of data to which msg refers to)
And broadcast this msg to subscribers to which it belongs to. Here, subscribers don't poll data from server but msg broker make send them as soon as it is available.

## When to Use it ?
Pub-Sub model mostly use in realtime application in which one client/publisher has to communicate with a lot of other services/subscribers.It can be used to improve
scalibility and can avoid multiple point of failures.

## Examples
- Event Notification
- Chat application
- Trading applications
